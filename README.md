# LECTURE_12_05

For the final lecture, we

* First did course evals for TAs (we already did course evals for the course and instructor on Monday)

Then we did a special "double standup" with the TWO teams in each lab section that share a TA:

|5pm | Jinjin | Events (Scott) | Sleep (Rachel) | 
|5pm | Santha | Gardens (Meredith) | QA (Ryan) | 
|6pm | Jinjin | Recommend (Eliza) | Kitchen (Sasha) | 
|6pm | Santha | Book (Areg) | Anon (Daniel) | 
|7pm | Jinjin | Buy (Wilson) | Whereis (Wei-Tung) | 
|7pm | Santha | Watch (Zihao) | u-to-do (Diego) | 

For double standup: 
* One person from each team should share the main "User Story" from the app.
* A different person should share with the OTHER TEAM
   * What is needed to startup the app
   * By that, I mean: do you need github oauth? an mlab database? firebase credentials?
   * Are all of those steps explained in the repo?
* IF NOT: when the standup is over, arrange yourselves Phelps 1260 according to this seating chart:
