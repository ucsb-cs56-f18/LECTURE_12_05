# LECTURE_12_05

For the final lecture, we

* First did course evals for TAs (we already did course evals for the course and instructor on Monday)

Then we did a special "double standup" with the TWO teams in each lab section that share a TA:

| lab | TA | team 1 | team 2 | Standup Where |
|----|--------|----------------|----------------|
|5pm | Jinjin | Events (Scott) | Sleep (Rachel) | FRONT of Phelps 1260 |
|5pm | Santha | Gardens (Meredith) | QA (Ryan) | Pillars outside Phelps 1260, to left |
|6pm | Jinjin | Recommend (Eliza) | Kitchen (Sasha) | Pillars outside Phelps 1260, to right |
|6pm | Santha | Book (Areg) | Anon (Daniel) | Pillars around the corner, close  |
|7pm | Jinjin | Buy (Wilson) | Whereis (Wei-Tung) | Pillars around the corner, far  |
|7pm | Santha | Watch (Zihao) | u-to-do (Diego) | BACK of Phelps 1260 |

For double standup: 
* One person from each team should share the main "User Story" from the app.
* A different person should share with the OTHER TEAM
   * What is needed to startup the app
   * By that, I mean: do you need github oauth? an mlab database? firebase credentials?
   * Are all of those steps explained in the repo?
   * YOU SHOULD NOT BE SHARING CREDENTIALS.  You should share INSTRUCTIONS.
   * If your mentor/TA cannot run your app without your credentials, YOU CANNOT EARN POINTS.
   * SO it's important to fix that!  We've left this time to fix those things.
* When he standup is over, arrange yourselves Phelps 1260 according to  seating chart below
* AND TRY EACH OTHERS APPS.   

1. Add each other (and the TA) to your communications channels (and phtcon@ucsb.edu)
2. Send on the communication channel:
   * The pull request for the latest version of the code
   * Any additional info needed to run the app
3. Then, make a new branch off whatever the last branch was. Call this branch `final-f18`
4. In that branch, make any needed adjustments in the README.md.
   * Also consider the contents of this repo: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-pconrad/spring-boot-app-config>
5. You'll also be doing some thing in that branch during your final lab on Thursday 12/6/2018
